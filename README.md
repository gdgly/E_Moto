# E_Moto
Electric Motorcycle Project

This Repo Contains everything related to the E-Moto build.

Architecture inlcudes everything from block diagrams of the system level, design calculations, reseach link to off-the-shelf parts, and anything else that isn't strict design work.

CAD includes mechanical CAD files (mostly Solid Works) of various custom parts of the bike. Also includes some side-projects and also tools that are relevant to this project.

Firware is the Embeded code that targets the dsPIC33 processor used in the Electronics. I would like to switch to an STM32 based system but its a little late for that now.

Hardware is Electrical Hardware designs based on KiCad. There are more projects started than will probably be finished here but thats ok!
